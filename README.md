Goal:

  The goal of the game is to survive 5 minutes in a ship that is rapidly sprouting leaks and filling with water.  The player must traverse the ship, gathering patch kits, the floating spinning wrenches, and using them to repair the holes in the ship.  In regular mode the player can hold a maximum of 3 patch kits at a time, while in nux mode they can hold 100.  The game ends when either the 5 minutes is up or the amount of water exceeds 66% of the ship.
